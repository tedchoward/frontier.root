#title "Fat Page Test"
#adrPageData "suites.states"
#isFatPage true
This page contains a packed copy of suites.states.

On a Mac: Choose the Get Page Data command from your web browser's Scripts menu to copy the object into your object database. 

On Windows, do it differently. Save the page to a local disk file, and open it in Frontier using File/Open. (This method also works on a Mac.)

Which way is better? Who knows!
