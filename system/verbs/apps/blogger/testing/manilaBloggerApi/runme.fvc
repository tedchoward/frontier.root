	«This script calls a Manila website using the Blogger API.
	«First, we create a new post. Then we edit it. If it works there should be a new item from John Q. Public at this URL:
	«http://bloggerapitest.manilasites.com/
	«Note that we're using a special account set up just to run these test scripts. People can test against Manila without having a Manila site. It's OK to use this info to test scripts in other environments. We want broad adoption of this API.
	«For further explanation see this item on today's Scripting News.
