FrontierVcsFile:3:optx:workspace.userlandSamples.threadWaiting.readMe

Shows how the realtime verbs work.
	To run the experiment, press Cmd-/ on the line below:
		workspace.userlandSamples.threadWaiting.launchThreadScript ()
	Wait a few seconds, then press Cmd-/ on this line:
		workspace.userlandSamples.threadWaiting.stopThreadScript ()
			// true
	You should see a dialog saying how long the script was running.
Then Cmd-/ the first script, but not the second:
	workspace.userlandSamples.threadWaiting.launchThreadScript ()
		// "The script has been launched!"
It should say the script was running for 15 seconds.
