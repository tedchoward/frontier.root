	When a new version of Font Awesome comes out, we need to rebuild the JSON that Fargo uses to create the Choose Icon dialog. The parser routine here does that.
	1. Get the latest Font Awesome, open font-awesome.css.
	2. Find fa-glass:before, select all the declarations from that point, to the end of the file. Copy.
	3. Paste into the text object in this table.
	4. Run parser.
	5. Copy the JSON text and paste it into the Fargo code.
