// 7/30/13 by DW
	It's time to convert the worknotes site for Fargo from the OPML Editor to Fargo itself.
	The convert script in this table starts with the input outline, which is a copy of the worknotes site, and processes it to produce a structure that can be opened in Fargo and copied into the docs.smallpict.com site. 
	From here, we'll just write the change notes in Fargo.
