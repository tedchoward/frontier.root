            "description": "Rudy is a 1993 American sports film directed by David Anspaugh. It is an account of the life of Daniel \"Rudy\" Ruettiger, who harbored dreams of playing football at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles. It was the first movie the Notre Dame administration allowed to be shot on campus since Knute Rockne, All American in 1940. In 2005, Rudy was named one of the best 25 sports movies of the previous 25 years in two polls by ESPN (#24 by a panel of sports experts, and #4 by espn.com users). It was ranked the 54th most inspiring film of all time in the \"AFI 100 Years\" series.",

            "description": "The Polar Express (also known as The Polar Express in 3D) is a 2004 Academy Award-nominated feature film based on the children's book of the same title by Chris Van Allsburg.\r\n\r\nThe film, written, produced, and directed by Robert Zemeckis, is entirely \"live action\" using performance capture technology, with the exception of the waiters who dispense hot chocolate on the train, because their feats were impossible for real-life actors to achieve. Performance capture technology incorporates the movements of live actors into animated characters. It stars actor Tom Hanks in five distinct roles, including the role of Santa Claus. The film was produced by Castle Rock Entertainment in association with Shangri-La Entertainment, ImageMovers, and Playtone, for Warner Bros. Pictures. The visual effects and performance capture was done at Sony Pictures Imageworks. The studio first released the $170 million film in both conventional and IMAX 3D theaters on Wednesday, November 10, 2004.",
