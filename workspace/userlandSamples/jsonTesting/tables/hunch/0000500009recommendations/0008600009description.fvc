The Polar Express (also known as The Polar Express in 3D) is a 2004 Academy Award-nominated feature film based on the children's book of the same title by Chris Van Allsburg.\r\n\r\nThe film, written, produced, and directed by Robert Zemeckis, is entirely \"live action\" using performance capture technology, with the exception of the waiters who dispense hot chocolate on the train, because their feats were impossible for real-life actors to achieve. Performance capture technology incorporates the movements of live actors into animated characters. It stars actor Tom Hanks in five distinct roles, including the role of Santa Claus. The film was produced by Castle Rock Entertainment in association with Shangri-La Entertainment, ImageMovers, and Playtone, for Warner Bros. Pictures. The visual effects and performance capture was done at Sony Pictures Imageworks. The studio first released the $170 million film in both conventional and IMAX 3D theaters on Wednesday, November 10, 2004.
