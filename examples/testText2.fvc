FrontierVcsFile:3:wptx:examples.testText2

This document is used in some of the examples in the Frontier Language Reference to demonstrate some of the word processing-related verbs.

It differs from examples.testText in that it has several paragraphs, where as the smaller document has only one paragraph.

It also has some styled text and some text that is centered, as in the paragraph below.

This is a centered paragraph in italics.
