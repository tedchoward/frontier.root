Chess is reputed to be one of the oldest games on Earth.  It may have originated in the pre-Christian era in what is today the Middle East.  Some scholars believe it derives from a court game played in ancient Egypt.

Played on an 8x8 square between two opposing armies of 16 players each, chess derives its intricacy from the fact that at any point in the game there are tens of thousands ‹ perhaps even millions ‹  of possible moves.  World-class chess players can "see" as much as six or eight moves ahead, which is quite an astounding mental feat.
